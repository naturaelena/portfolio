This project was implemented using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
Before training ML model data has been analyzed through data visualisation, then data was split with "train_test_split"
As a result we pompared MAE, RMSE, naive_mean and naive_median between Linear Regression and Decision Tree models
